# Hint.sass [v1.2.1]
*A tooltip library in Sass for your lovely websites. This is a fork of [Hint.css](http://kushagragour.in/lab/hint/) and offers namespaced or "@extend-only" Sass selectors.*

## Deprecated: Hint.css is now written using Sass and this repository is not updated since a few years ago.
