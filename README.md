# Hint.sass [v1.2.1]
*A tooltip library in Sass for your lovely websites. This is a fork of [Hint.css](http://kushagragour.in/lab/hint/) and offers namespaced or "@extend-only" Sass selectors.*

`hint.css` is written as a pure CSS resource using which you can create cool tooltips for your web app. It does not rely on JavaScript and rather uses **data-* attribute**, **pseudo elements**, **content property** and **CSS3 transitions** to create the tooltips. Also it uses **BEM** naming convention particularly for the modifiers.
