# Hint.sass [v1.2.1]
*A tooltip library in Sass for your lovely websites. This is a fork of [Hint.css](http://kushagragour.in/lab/hint/) and offers namespaced or "@extend-only" Sass selectors.*

## Deprecated: this repository is not updated since a few years ago. You'll be best served by the original [Hint.css](http://kushagragour.in/lab/hint/) library which is also written using Sass.
